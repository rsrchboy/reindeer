- add weaver.ini to invoke (the possibly poorly named)
  Pod::Weaver::Section::Collect::FromOther, so that we can document without
  redocumenting
- Add Path::Class to our exports
- Add MooseX::Types::Path::Class, ::Tied::IxHash, etc.
- Add a number of "optional" traits, by ensuring aliases are exported for them
- Add trait_aliases where any of our attribute extensions don't provide them
  on their own; this allows for a more consistent interface, especially when
  the traits may need to be applied manually (e.g. to extended attributes from
  a superclass)
